# A Repo which contains codesnippets for quick Python code

In my current job, I notice I use a lot of small(, efficient) parts of Python code to get things done. I simply cannot remember all the small syntax things and especially during cases I want quick, ready to use snippets to gather information.

## Main Development

Mainly the snippets will be developed and tested on Windows, but it will be indicated per sample where is was actually tested.

## Currently contains:

- IterateAllFiles
    - IterateAllFiles.py -> Example Iterator over directories using Glob.
    - Oberser.py -> Example Class which can to be used in combination with IterateAllFiles.py or acts as Class example. It will create a dict about all iterated files and their paths.
- BasicArgParse
    - ArgParse.py -> Example Argument Parser over directories using the argparse Python module.
